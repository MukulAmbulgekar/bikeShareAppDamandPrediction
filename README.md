*  Get real time status of available Bikes/Docks at a particular bike station
*  Get weather information
*  Search places on google maps to get bike status.
*  Suggest new Bike Stations
* K-Means Clustering for stations based on number of trips

** Features to be implemented **
* Demand prediction Algorithm
* Big data analysis  - web dashboard
* Android Mobile Application for real time analysis and status of bike stations
